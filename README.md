# Chase Game 🎯🚀

**Chase** is a fun and engaging 2D game where the player controls a chaser to catch moving targets while avoiding obstacles. This game, built using Python's Turtle graphics library, is easy to play but offers a challenge for those who enjoy strategy and quick reflexes.

## Game Overview 🎮

The objective is simple: chase and capture randomly generated moving targets on the screen. But beware! You must avoid obstacles, which are square-shaped, and don’t collide with the game zone’s borders. 

Chase features two modes:
- **Normal Mode**: A regular-paced game suitable for casual players.
- **Hard Mode**: A faster, more challenging experience for seasoned gamers.

With background music and sound effects, this game delivers an immersive experience while keeping track of your high scores on a built-in leaderboard.

## Key Features ✨

- 🎮 **Two Game Modes**: Play in Normal Mode or push your limits in Hard Mode.
- 🔄 **Random Generation**: Targets and obstacles are generated randomly to ensure each game is unique.
- 🏆 **Score Tracking & Leaderboard**: Compete with yourself or others by recording high scores.
- 🎹 **Immersive Sound Effects & Background Music**: Enhance gameplay with cool audio.
- 🖥️ **Simple GUI**: Powered by Tkinter for easy navigation between game menus and the leaderboard.
