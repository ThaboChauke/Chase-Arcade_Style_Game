# Chase-Snake_Type

Chase-Arcade_Style_Game is a simple arcade-style game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. In this game, the player controls an arrow-shaped chaser turtle within a bordered area. The objective is to chase and "eat" randomly appearing red circular targets while avoiding hitting the borders of the game zone. The player's score increases each time a target is successfully reached.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls: Use the left and right arrow keys to rotate the chaser turtle.
- Randomly generated targets: Targets appear at random positions within the game zone.
- Score tracking: The player's score is displayed on the screen, updating in real-time as targets are collected.
- Game over mechanism: The game ends if the chaser turtle collides with the borders of the game zone. A message box displays the final score, and the player can enter their name for the leaderboard.

## Dependencies

This game requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

- `turtle`: Turtle graphics library for drawing and animation.
- `random`: Python's built-in module for generating random numbers.
- `tkinter`: Python's standard GUI toolkit for creating message boxes.

## How to Run

To play the game, simply execute the Python script `Chase-Arcade_Style_Game`. The game window will appear, and you can start playing immediately. Follow the on-screen instructions to control the chaser turtle and collect targets.
